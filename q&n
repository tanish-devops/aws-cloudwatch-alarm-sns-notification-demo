Q-What happens the moment a threshold is crossed?
A-Three things:
The Alarm changes status to ALARM.
It sends a JSON "payload" to your chosen SNS Topic.
SNS "fans out" that message to your email, SMS, or even a Lambda function to auto-fix the issue.

Q: Does CloudWatch send the email directly to my Gmail?
A: Not quite! CloudWatch is the trigger, but Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is the messenger. 
CloudWatch tells SNS, "Hey, the alarm went off!" and SNS then sends the email to your inbox

Q: Will I get spammed with 100 emails if my CPU stays high for an hour?
A: No. By default, CloudWatch only sends a notification when the state changes (e.g., from OK to ALARM).
It won't send another email until the alarm resets to OK and trips again.
